# Search Algorithms

## Introduction

Search algorithms are fundamental techniques for finding specific data within a structure, such as arrays, trees, or graphs.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, commonly used in tree and graph traversal.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## A* Search Algorithm
A* is a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node using heuristics.
